Tell me, shot the screen beforehand and then use the current location to determine the position of cropping.
Use stack method. crop with timestamp?
Check the effect first. Is it really numpy array?

We can relearn everything anytime. The GUI is such a thing.
You can simply query it, do the redis stuff.
You know, check if there is a click or two.

networking is not really good. it does not provide solid interface.
You can also try some graph work. do the timeline chains. check only last ids.
Time crucial task. where is the click? is it different thing here?

Real-time mouse tracking can be done using limited crop.
Again, this is not for my convenience. and it is bad.

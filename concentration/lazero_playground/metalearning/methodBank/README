I THINK HOOGLE IS ENOUGH FOR THOSE HARDCORE DEVS BUT NOW I HAVE ENCOUNTERED SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE CODEBASE OF UNICODE TABLE. I NEED A SOLUTION. I NEED TO WORK IT OUT ON MY OWN.

Based on my philosophy just make definition, tags and methods shall be enough. You need to crrate a discrete class for it.
And in order to make it indexable, I need to either store it into database or simply some pickle or other methods whatever can deal with the storage of classes.

It could be multilingual, but that's another story.

It has to be in its puriest form. the variables can have arbitrary name to make methods communicative.

We will make use of the uuid module, to create unique dill class objects and modified source code right at the spot. mention the origin beforehand.

How to make our experiment controllable?
I'm sorry but AUTOEXPECT IS AWESOME!

The log file of expect can log anything.

we only log usable hints. Use uuid as token.

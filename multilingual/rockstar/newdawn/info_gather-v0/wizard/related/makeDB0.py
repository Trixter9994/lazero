# you have to let some intermediate things going through before putting the data into the fucking graph database.
# alphabetical order, case relationship are all one-directional.
# the lables can have relationships too.
# but what is the difference here? shall we check something as not usable?
# just by putting all labels into an array? shall we distinguish them?
# i mean at least wee have the alphabetical order.
# insert random stuff first? or just make sure the relationship is kept?

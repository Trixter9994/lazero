what do you want to do in this fucking lab?
only hand-crafted shits. I ain't got nothing with the fucking shit.
alright then. i just want to make sure that my standard spliters get out.

--------TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION--------

you need to know that you are not genius. thses functions are for experts, and all you have got is shit.
no need to do the comprehension. we do the most basic machine learning from here.
you, must start with some basic operations:
1. shift
2. tweak
3. switch
Also, you need not only to fine grain the ibgredents, but also to separate, categorize them. You must group something together when in need.

two grouping methods:
1. inclusion
2. exclusion or encapsule.

--------- REMEMBER THE RULE HERE ---------

never ignore the content. if you do, then you will never get the idea of the punctuation.
consider the time-space distance. when the space is large, or the relevancy is low, then you shall put each of them into different group.

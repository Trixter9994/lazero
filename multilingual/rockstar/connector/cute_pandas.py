# i oculd not process the hierachy data, therefore i can only do this by only one fucking way: to store it into some graph database.

# the way to another fucking space!
# to another dimension!
# if using other shits, then you probably don't have to work in this way.
# do not omit anything.
# maybe you want to have some kind of type checking at this time, but when scanning those archives, you might want to turn this off.
# the type checking tool is another ultimate fucking killer equipment, which does not judge the file only by its fucking extension but actually by its fucking content!
# this dictionary could be created through another function.

# i don't give a shit about the fucking name.
# just a fucking freaky name and nothing else.
# hey you freak! what if we have the same subdirectory name for the fucking sake?
# things could get messy here!
# this should never be happening!
# i was a fool, and now still i am.
# you must make distinct things for distinct shits.
# otherwise your balls will be melted into one.
# i have a final solution.
# the tracedown link.
# right after the fucking list2.
# you could make maximum shit for it, and of the fucking course you shall make it empty to keep the format.
# keep the fucking format.
# i don't wanna tell shit about this at all.
# load csv is freaking evil, but it is blasting fast.
# you shall always use something like that.

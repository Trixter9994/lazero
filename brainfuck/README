I can always recall the first day i saw it.

what the heck!
ai can write code, but it is in brainfuck, not like any other programming language I've learned so far.

worst of all, i even cannot tell where the heck i saw this example!

fortunately, internet's got decent memory. i can retrieve this shit anytime.

maybe a custom intepreter of brainfuck will be better?
a highlighter for brainfuck?
WTF!

haskell vs. brainfuck! perfect fucking combination!

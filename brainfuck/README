I can always recall the first day i saw it.

what the heck!
ai can write code, but it is in brainfuck, not like any other programming language I've learned so far.

worst of all, i even cannot tell where the heck i saw this example!

fortunately, internet's got decent memory. i can retrieve this shit anytime.

maybe a custom intepreter of brainfuck will be better?
a highlighter for brainfuck?
WTF!

haskell vs. brainfuck! perfect fucking combination!

apt install beef gir1.2-cattle-1.0 hsbrainfuck libcattle-1.0-0 libcattle-1.0-dev libcattle-1.0-doc libghc-brainfuck-dev libghc-brainfuck-doc libghc-brainfuck-prof

the speed is limited. but i've made things offline.

The command below just won't work. I do not know why.
    firefox -P scraper -headless --screenshot  yankee.png "file:///root/AGI/lazero/brainfuck/fix_x_torch.html"

It turns out to be a pop-up over the place. Error message, but being ignored.
So toggling switches is needed when SHIT happens.
Set it to default profile and retry.

it is all about headless mode and screenshot.
and they are combined.
fuck.

maybe it is about the canvas? too damn big?
so never do screenshot to unbounded objects.

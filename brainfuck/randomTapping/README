about to initialize a minimized kernel on VM.

also consider some emulation on cellphone.

it's gonna be chaotic, but it is needed to get the response.

collect the data for further implementation.

also, the image is getting bigger than expected. think about the final size.

it's clearly not going to be pleasant.

5min -> 112k
60/5=12, ih -> 112*12k
1d -> 9h -> 112*9*12k = 112*9*12/1024mb = 11.8mb
1y -> 4.3g

would you like to place it elsewhere?
yes. but only after my implementation on random tapping.

it is the direct approach on automated machine and self-aware machine.

all the code, all the laws, written by me and the entire humanity, exist around this world.

it is weird that machine cannot run properly without code. but what's the real thing that keeps it going?

consider linking with your phone, and charge it while doing stuff.

this is the standard file which waiting for you to split.
you come on, yeah you better bring your crew with you.
now i just want to wait and see. what do you have here actually?
i can split anything recursively, and i ain't got no mercy.
the final shit could be done in the end (the wormhole mark or by regex or some other shits).
i guess the punctuations are not inside the word list, or at least not even a common thing inside a dictionary (i mean index). So we can get them out pretty easily.
mark them up and put a rank over them. i wanna see the shit.
hey! give you this thing, you may consider it as some thing good. THE INCLUSION ALGORITHM.
Simply, if something is inside the interval of another thing's interval, then the other thing is considered superior than the former. also, if it appears to be less frequent  than the former (by this i mean the period, or just some local period i think).
also you need to teach the computer to consider brackets as another thing which needs to be concluded, appears as a group and cannot be simply parsed as something normal.
RANK IT. the word could be a mess if without the thing.
find out local pattern.  when local pattern extends, then it becomes global pattern.
DO NOT EXECUTE TXT FILES OR YOU WILL DIE. UNKNOWN TEXT PATTERNS COULD BE LETHAL.

now we are gonna apply financial methods into natural language processing! what a joke! but this is true. nevertheless financial methods are great when including the historical data to fool investers, but text files are history and we can never fool anyone when it is all set and done (Hilbert Space Integrated).

Be in the army is just another reason to die.
I had better keep my fucking choice.

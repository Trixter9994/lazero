    "**Optimization** refers to the task of minimizing/maximizing an objective function $f(x)$ parameterized by $x$. In machine/deep learning terminology, it's the task of minimizing the cost/loss function $J(w)$ parameterized by the model's parameters $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. Optimization algorithms (in case of minimization) have one of the following goals:\n",
    "- Find the global minimum of the objective function. This is feasible if the objective function is convex, i.e. any local minimum is a global minimum.\n",
    "- Find the lowest possible value of the objective function within its neighbor. That's usually the case if the objective function is not convex as the case in most deep learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of optimization algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimization algorithm that is not iterative and simply solves for one point.\n",
    "- Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and converges to acceptable solution regardless of the parameters initialization such as gradient descent applied to logistic regression.\n",
    "- Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and applied to a set of problems that have non-convex cost functions such as neural networks. Therefore, parameters' initialization plays a critical role in speeding up convergence and achieving lower error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent** is the most common optimization algorithm in *machine learning* and *deep learning*. It is a first-order optimization algorithm. This means it only takes into account the first derivative when performing the updates on the parameters. On each iteration, we update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function $J(w)$ w.r.t to the parameters where the gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent. The size of the step we take on each iteration to reach the local minimum is determined by the learning rate $\\alpha$. Therefore, we follow the direction of the slope downhill until we reach a local minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover gradient descent algorithm and its variants: *Batch Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first see how gradient descent and its associated steps works on logistic regression before going into the details of its variants. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the logistic regression model has only two parameters: weight $w$ and bias $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize weight $w$ and bias $b$ to any random numbers.\n",
    "2. Pick a value for the learning rate $\\alpha$. The learning rate determines how big the step would be on each iteration.\n",
    "    * If $\\alpha$ is very small, it would take long time to converge and become computationally expensive.\n",
    "    * IF $\\alpha$ is large, it may fail to converge and overshoot the minimum.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Therefore, plot the cost function against different values of $\\alpha$ and pick the value of $\\alpha$ that is right before the first value that didn't converge so that we would have a very fast learning algorithm that converges (see figure 2).\n",

    "Below are some challenges regarding gradient descent algorithm in general as well as its variants - mainly batch and mini-batch:\n",
    "- Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm, which means it doesn't take into account the second derivatives of the cost function. However, the curvature of the function affects the size of each learning step. The gradient measures the steepness of the curve but the second derivative measures the curvature of the curve. Therefore, if:\n",
    "    - Second derivative = 0 $\\rightarrow$ the curvature is linear. Therefore, the step size = the learning rate $\\alpha$.\n",
    "    - Second derivative > 0 $\\rightarrow$ the curvature is going upward. Therefore, the step size < the learning rate $\\alpha$ and may lead to divergence.\n",
    "    - Second derivative < 0 $\\rightarrow$ the curvature is going downward. Therefore, the step size > the learning rate $\\alpha$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As a result, the direction that looks promising to the gradient may not be so and may lead to slow the learning process or even diverge.\n",
    "- If Hessian matrix has poor conditioning number, i.e. the direction of the most curvature has much more curvature than the direction of the lowest curvature. This will lead the cost function to be very sensitive in some directions and insensitive in other directions. As a result, it will make it harder on the gradient because the direction that looks promising for the gradient may not lead to big changes in the cost function (see figure 7).\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "- The norm of the gradient $g^Tg$ is supposed to decrease slowly with each learning step because the curve is getting flatter and steepness of the curve will decrease. However, we see that the norm of the gradient is increasing, because of the curvature of the curve. Nonetheless, even though the gradients' norm is increasing, we're able to achieve a very low error rates  (see figure 8).\n",

    "- In small dimensions, local minimum is common; however, in large dimensions, saddle points are more common. Saddle point is when the function curves up in some directions and curves down in other directions. In other words, saddle point looks a minimum from one direction and a maximum from other direction (see figure 9). This happens when at least one eigenvalue of the hessian matrix is negative and the rest of eigenvalues are positive.\n",

    "- As discussed previously, choosing a proper learning rate is hard. Also, for mini-batch gradient descent, we have to adjust the learning rate during the training process to make sure it converges to the local minimum and not wander around it. Figuring out the decay rate of the learning rate is also hard and changes with different datasets.\n",
    "- All parameter updates have the same learning rate; however, we may want to perform larger updates to some parameters that have their directional derivatives more inline with the trajectory towards the minimum than other parameters."

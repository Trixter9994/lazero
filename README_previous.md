## Actually I don't give a shit about license
Once upon a time, I saw some companies were forced to share part of their code due to the legal restriction of GPL, so I wanted to put mine under that too. But actually, no matter what license is put under my fucking project, no one will even give a shit about my project for the fuck sake!

It is when I realize how good to have WTFPL here. You might see some 3rd party code fetched from here and there inside this project, but I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEIR LICENSE, AND I DO NOT RESPECT THEIR COPYRIGHT. My work here is utterly clear: to try my best to make it work. Any other things are out of my consideration.

## I don't give a shit about the consequence
There might be some reports saying robot riots or disadvantages of agent AIs, BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT IT. All that I can see here is a trashed lot. Piles of shits are placed everywhere, and misinformation transfers into everyone's ears.

I AM TRYING MY BEST TO MAKE A REAL AGENT AI, A REAL GENERAL PROBLEM SOLVER TO FREE EVERY INDIVIDUAL ON EARTH FROM WORK. You may use it to do anything, including massacre if you wish to BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT.

## Thinking is evil, learning is evil, working is evil
I HATE REPETITIVE TASK. In the past, I only refer few actions as repetitive but now I have realized that EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS REPETITIVE. I then doubt why this is true and the answer is obvious. IT IS THE NATURE OF NATURE.

Maybe someone will consider time traveling after this project is done but I have to say: NO MORE TRICKS ON US, NATURE.

it could be decent if one can make some tempfile in memory to store html.

it would be great if we all can access some files in memory via url or some database or just some output generated by another program and then suddenly every shit will thenbe solved.

consider some virtual file objects, if any.
direct access to memory? c language?

these are identical outputs. beware.

one could train the bot to find some files inside the xml tree, finding structures inside by comparing the formatted document and the html thing.

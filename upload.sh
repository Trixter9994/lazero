# there's no fucking shit about perfect design.
# nope. there's not.
# remember you will never be able to write the core on your own.
# REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO WRITE THE CORE ON YOUR OWN.
# it is just a platform.
# just remember it will never gonna win.
# and this piece of code is far from perfect.
# fucking data?
# just consider it.
# the thing is not right. you'd better let your computer learn it. test if it can run the stuff.
# you already have it.
# both static and dynamic.
# informative and functional.
# just some verifications.
# ask your machine to type "I WILL KILL ALL HUMEN"?
# do not hope to do perfect shit. think only about those things that you can do right now.
# never mind. it is all about practice.
# you can do this to achieve anything.
# but how the fuck does that thing works out?
# calm down.
# you do not love files, but these are like books for your machine.
# you want to build a system crawler? can't crawl from the web?
# whatever you say. IT IS NOW MY BRAIN NOT WORKING PROPERLY.
# I NEED TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION.
# you see, it is all just about learning. learning matters the most.
# and you have not build a unified agent to learn all these stuffs.
# check what to imitate. is it about the OPERATE SYSTEM?

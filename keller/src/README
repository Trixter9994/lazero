go ahead, solve your problem in a brand new way instead of just manual looking and pasting. that's the purpose.

diff rule: similar -> perform similarity test -> continue on children

they force me to become a hacker. they deserve this: death.

background -> request, handle cookies, browser history, favourites.

tabs -> content processing, subrequest.

firefox -> about:config -> websocket allow from https

or add your root certificate. or just allow exceptions:

certificate manager -> server -> add exception

chrome -> chrome://flags -> allow invalid certs from localhost

allow insecure websockets.

add ca to system so normal code will be running fine.

what if this computer is blind and cannot see things around? maybe some mental disabilities? check project keller out.

collect info, and understand it by heart, so the endless darkness will not hinder our steps.

source code -> compile -> assembly code

you can play with sounds, also can play with code.

scratch pad should be in ram. so do it in c in windows?

generate fake text for great good. for internal practice, POC.

you cannot be perfect all the time.

as a human, you will never be able to run the code like the machine. no
machine code is running under whatever architecture. and you shall not regret
this.

look at this computer too. maybe no language can understand each other
finally, no architecture will agree with each other, but it is still running.

so it is not wrong to understand the superficial things. not wrong to collect
over the internet.

even if our spirits will not meet.
